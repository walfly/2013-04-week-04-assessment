List the main differences you can think of between relational databases and non-relational ones.

Relational databases involve relations that join your data together.  This affords additional flexibility and speed in queries, but makes it very difficult to augment the structure once implemented.  Non-relational databases can evolve over there time as adding to the data structure doesn't involve rewriting everything. However, they don't afford constant time look ups.
